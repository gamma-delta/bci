Last post I said this post would be about BCI stuff. And I guess it kinda is in a way, but really
it's more interesting than that.

I went to the robotics club meeting on Saturday! 

It was pretty cool. There were a couple guys,
one really short girl, and one really tall girl. And then me.

Mostly we just chatted and ate snacks. Some of the boys are making an electric go-kart from scratch,
but it was raining today so they couldn't bring it over to the classroom we met in. Plus they kinda seem like jerks
anyways.

I managed to tell the club I wanted to experiment with brain-computer interfaces and they thought it was really cool. 
I also mentioned I was no good at hardware-level electronics and the really tall girl volunteered to help me.

I *also* also mentioned I wrote a blog, and they thought that was pretty cool, so I wrote the link on the
smartboard. (Hello, \<college\> robotics club members! Thanks, Kyra!)

I kinda gave up going to club meetings a few years ago cause I would always go *once*, and then the 
amount-I-want-to-go to busy ratio never worked out again. But I really like the atmosphere here so I think I'll 
go again next Saturday.

I wonder if I'm writing differently knowing that people from the robotics club know I'm writing about them.
Like, I'm not going to say I dislike any of them because I know the person I'm disparaging might read about it.
But I don't especially dislike any of them, so I wouldn't say so anyways...

Maybe I *should* take a psych class. I wonder if psych classes are like, filters or magnets for all the people 
who obsessively think about things like this.
