Sorry it's been a while since I posted. On the other hand that means I have lots to update you on!

## The Eclipse!

I went out and saw the eclipse 2 nights ago. Fortunately it was nice and clear out. I was worried it would
be cloudy. *Un*fortunately I didn't take any pictures... but it's all over social media, so I can't imagine 
you're at a shortage of eclipse pics, dear reader.

It was really beautiful and really eerie, blood red. Like an eye closing to weep tears of blood.

Wow that was the cringiest thing I've ever written. Moving on,

## Halloween

I used to love Halloween when I was younger. I *love* dressing up, but now that I don't really have anyone to
encourage me to do it I don't really bother anymore. It kinda lost the charm once I entered middle school
and I never got back around to it.

Nowadays I just go to the store on the day after and buy all the cheap candy.

I also just don't know what I'd dress up *as*. Most of the media I consume is old kid's cartoons and I wouldn't be
caught dead dressing up as my favorite characters from those. Also no one knows who Entrapta or Mellifluous are.

## BCI Progress

I've been chatting with RZTD over Dynamo. They sent me some code that bypasses the library and just interfaces with the
GPIO pins directly somehow to make communications work.

So, I've managed to get the amount the dial (sorry, the "potentiometer") is turned printing to the terminal. Next step
is getting the devkit hooked up. I would have done it yesterday but robotics club was cancelled cause it was Halloween,
of course.

## Future of the Blog

Maybe I should get into the habit of writing one of these every month or something.

I really want to get my brain hooked up to a computer, and I want this blog to be the record of it.
But I do notice that most of my posts haven't been much about any cool things I'm doing with a BCI and more about
my life and struggles.

Maybe that's more interesting though. Here's hoping.
