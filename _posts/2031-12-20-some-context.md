I was thinking about yesterday's blog post and realized it made even less sense than usual, so here's some context
I feel I should provide.

## "Class"

I went to a clarinet master class yesterday. If you don't know, it's when a master clarinet player does a public class
with their student. So you pay a nominal fee to be in the audience and watch a high-level class, and the class is
structured to be informative to the audience. And because it was 7:15am when I wrote yesterday's post I was tired
out of my mind and just called it "class," cause usually I have college classes to go to when I wake up that early.

So no, I don't suddenly have school in the middle of winter break.

Dunno why I feel obligated to say all this, but ... I dunno, I always feel like I have to clarify everything, even
things that don't really need clarification?

Anyways, I'm writing this from the Minneapolis airport. I'm flying out to visit my parents for Christmas, and my flight's
delayed, and I had some time, so I thought I might as well.

I like airports. I remember watching a documentary when I was really young about aviation and commercial flight and all,
and being *fascinated*. It's kind of amazing all the stuff that happens in the backend to get us where we're going.
I love stuff like that, backrooms and electrical closets and water towers.

I'm still thinking about yesterday's dream. It's a weird thing to ideate on, I guess... but it's just stuck in my head.

So, yeah, short post, I don't have much else to write about. See you in the new years, I guess.
Here's to a good 2032.
