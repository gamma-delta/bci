Hello! I'm Brian, a computer programmer and college student living somewhere in the American Midwest.
Welcome to my blog.

I'll post my experiences about working with brain-computer interfaces here. Expect anecdotes and
stories alongside practical code samples.

This blog is a work of fiction, by the way. Just to be clear. It's actually written by Petra,
a computer programmer also living in the American Midwest.
